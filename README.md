# Uber vs The Yellow Taxi: Should Uber be capped in NYC?

Uber has disrupted New York City's once-thriving yellow taxi industry, driving many companies into bankruptcy. For this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Uber's ridership data using data science tools like Pandas, Pandasql, and Matplotlib to demonstrate Uber's dominance in the taxi market. Additionally, I explored Uber's lobbying strategies.

Enjoy.
